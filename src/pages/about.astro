			<h1>About</h1>

			<section class="bio">
				<p>
					Hi! I'm Martin, a Principal Consultant and developer based in the UK. I specialize in building scalable applications with .NET/C#, Azure, and modern cloud technologies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Currently, I'm exploring AI-powered development workflows, creating tools to enhance developer productivity, and contributing to open source projects.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="interests">
				<h2>Current Focus</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>AI-Assisted Development</strong> - Building tools and workflows that leverage AI for code generation, refactoring, and automation</li>
					<li><strong>Developer Tooling</strong> - Creating utilities that improve the development experience</li>
					<li><strong>Cloud Architecture</strong> - Designing and implementing scalable cloud solutions on Azure and AWS</li>
					<li><strong>DevOps Practices</strong> - CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and container orchestration with Kubernetes</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>
					I've been working in software development for over 15 years, starting with .NET in its early days and evolving through the full stack to modern cloud-native architectures.
				</p>
				<p>
					My experience spans multiple industries including finance, healthcare, and public sector. I've led teams, architected systems, and shipped products used by millions.
				</p>

				<h2>Beyond the Keyboard</h2>
				<p>
					When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me running or cycling. I believe physical challenges and mental challenges go hand in hand—both require discipline, persistence, and the ability to push through when things get difficult.
				</p>
				<div class="achievement">
					<h3>South Downs Way 100</h3>
					<p class="achievement-meta">
						<a href={stravaActivityUrl} target="_blank" rel="noopener">View activity on Strava →</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Completed the 100-mile ultramarathon along the South Downs Way—a point-to-point trail from Eastbourne to Winchester. It's a race that tests not just physical endurance but mental resilience, with 12,000ft of elevation gain and a 30-hour cutoff.
					</p>
					<p>
						The experience taught me lessons that directly apply to software development: proper preparation matters, pace yourself for the long game, and sometimes you just need to put one foot in front of the other and keep going.

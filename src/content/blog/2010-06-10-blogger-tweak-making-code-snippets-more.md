Now that I’m blogging more code snippet heavy content it’s becoming apparent that the excellent [Code Snippet Plugin with Windows Live Writer](http://bit.ly/b3qMyO+) isn’t the most usable for people trying to copy the snippet for their own use.  So I’ve created a Blogger Template tweak to automatically add a ‘plain text/formatted’ toggle.  

  To install simply copy the snippet below into your Blogger Template just above the </body> tag.

  
```
var ChildText = function(nodeList) {
```

Enjoy!

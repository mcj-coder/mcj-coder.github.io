Well, it was bound to happen. I rebuilt my PC and forgot to install my dev tools… oh well. In an attempt to stop this from ever happening again, I'm creating a dev VM which will be backed up onto my NAS device.

The applications I'm installing for (ASP.Net Development) are:

- VMWare Player 3.0.1 (FileHippo)
  - 2GB Memory
  - 1 Processor
  - Bridged Network
  - 40GB C: (_System and Applications_)
  - 60GB D: (_Data_)
  - Windows 7 Professional x64
- Firefox with Extensions:
  - Firebug
  - YSlow
  - Web Developer Toolbar
  - HTML Validator
  - Selenium IDE
- Microsoft Web Platform Installer
  - Web Server – Recommended Products + SEO Toolkit
  - Framework – Recommended Products + ASP.NET MVC 2
  - Database – Recommended Products + SQL2008 Management Studio Express
- CCleaner (FileHippo)
  - Include the Temporary ASP.NET Files directory

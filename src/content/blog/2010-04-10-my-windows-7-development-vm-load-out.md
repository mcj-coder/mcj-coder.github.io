Well, it was bound to happen.  I rebuilt my PC and forgot to install my dev tools… oh well.  In an attempt to stop this from ever happening again, I’m creating a dev VM which will be backed up onto my NAS device.

The applications I’m installing for (ASP.Net Development) are:

        * 1 Processor
        * Bridged Network

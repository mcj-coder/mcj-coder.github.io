*My WebHost4Life Trials are over.  I was finally let in to a secret cabal of WH4L users who know the secret truth behind the ‘migration’ myth….the old control panel still exists!  Yay!  It only took a week of chasing support staff daily.*  

  So, now I’ve got control of the database, DNS records, etc, etc.  VWT2OC has moved to it’s new home with Arvixe.  The page load for the [n2cms](http://bit.ly/aco4m4) build has dropped from ~15s to ~4s from an empty cache and the first request time for a freshly recycled app pool is ~10 seconds – not a minute!

  Now all I need is another week off work so I can actually get the website integration done.

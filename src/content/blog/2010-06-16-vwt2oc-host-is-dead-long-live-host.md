_My WebHost4Life Trials are over. I was finally let in to a secret cabal of WH4L users who know the secret truth behind the 'migration' myth….the old control panel still exists! Yay! It only took a week of chasing support staff daily._

So, now I've got control of the database, DNS records, etc, etc. VWT2OC has moved to its new home with Arvixe. The page load for the n2cms build has dropped from ~15s to ~4s from an empty cache and the first request time for a freshly recycled app pool is ~10 seconds – not a minute!

Now all I need is another week off work so I can actually get the website integration done.
